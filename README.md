##Photo Sharing App

Let's make an app that lets users upload their photos to share with the world.

Start off by letting people create accounts, following along with the authentication Railscast.

Then, let them upload photos.

Next, allow them to tag other users in photos. To keep this simple, just display a list of all the users in a drop-down menu when you add a tag to a photo.
